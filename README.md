# MRVIST
Meandering River Variability in Storage Time
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

The overall structure of this code is to take output files from the MRDAST simulation or from the Zenodo data repository and depict the variability in the sediment storage times in the simulated data.

A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time.
