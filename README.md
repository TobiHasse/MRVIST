# MRVIST
Meandering River Variability in Storage Time
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

### Function and use
- MVIST uses input files which are output files from MRDAST (https://github.com/TobiHasse/MRDAST)
- The input files containt a MATLAB arrays of the storage time distributions for sediment deposited in the floodplains as well as other parameters for the meandring river model run
- MRVIST outputs include visualizations, cross-correlation, and violin plots of various metrics of sediment storage time and the dynamic evolution of the channel planform

### Input and output files

- input files include the storage distribution files generated by MRDAST and other model parameter files
- output files will be similar to the files from my dissertation on https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.5651874

The code in this repository is required for my dissertation: Hasse, Tobias Raphael. "Storage Time Dynamics of Meandering River Floodplain Sediments: A Modeling Study." PhD diss., University of Delaware, 2021.

The dissertation includes the code as appendices and that code runs to completion but is dependant on the following MATLAB toolboxes:
- The Econometrics Toolbox
- distributionPlot from the Matlab File Exchange: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23661-violin-plots-for-plotting-multiple-distributions-distributionplot-m
- The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is required by distributionPlot

- A future release of MRVIST will remove the Econometrics and Statistics Toolbox dependancies

The overall structure of this code is to take output files from the MRDAST simulation or from the Zenodo data repository and depict the variability in the sediment storage times in the simulated data.

A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time. NOW COMPLETED!
